<h2>Client Report</h2>
<p>As a client I feel like I provided all the information needed to my lead developer for them to be succesful. The lead developer for my site
    was very good and she kept in touch to try and make everything as I wanted it, I think she did a great job. Next time to do things differently I will
    make a more in depth overview of my site and include all the pictures needed.
</p>

<h2>Lead Developer Report</h2>
<p>I don't think I was a very good lead develoer, I did get in touch with my two junior developers but I didn't really tell them what
    they were supposed to be doing. I did not communicate well with my client or with my junior developers.
</p>

<h2>Jr Developer Report</h2>
<p>As a junior developr I had a bad experience, one of the people I was a junior developr for nevery actually reached out to me, so I couldn't 
    help him out, then the other guy I was a junior developer for sent me the site plan and everything I needed the like an hour before everything was due.
</p>

<h2>General Experience</h2>
<p>Overall it was a stressful experience, I feel like we knew everything we needed to know to be succesful, but in order for us to be able to complete 
    this assignment we had to rely on other people to be there, I also feel like it would have taken me 6-7 hours to finish it. I loved coming up with the 
    idea of my ptoject but that's because I thought I was going to be the one designing it. It felt we were given a big work load and we hadn't ever worked
    on any this big on our own. The thing I enjoyed most was working on it on my own and trying to be able to figure things out. I do feel like it helped
    me to understand and learn more, I feel more comfortable with this kind of stuff, but it was just a huge amount of work to do.
